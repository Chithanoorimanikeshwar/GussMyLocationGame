shipGenerate:
1.random positioning of ship.
  v.1.geneterate starting row position from 0to3
  v.2.generate column postion from oto5
  h.1.generate row postion from 0to5.
  h.2.generate starting column position from 0to3.
2.create a new ship array and push the  ganerated location into it
3.return the array

locations:
1.using ship generation function generate three ships.
2.check whether any colling amoung the ships.
  t.regenerate the ships.
  f.1.convert the generated ship locations to respective board locations.
  f.2.send them to model locations properties.

collisions:
1.check the location collisions.
  t.return false.
  f.return true.

covertion:
1.convert the roandom generated locations into the form "A1".
2.return the loactions
